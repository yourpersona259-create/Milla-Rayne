# Milla Rayne AI Assistant - Setup Guide

## ✅ Current Status: **SUCCESSFULLY RUNNING**

The AI-powered virtual assistant companion is now up and running with the following core features working:

### 🎯 Working Features
- **Vector-based memory recall system** (5913 memory entries loaded)
- **Chat interface with conversation history**
- **Face recognition system**
- **Visual memory storage**
- **Personality settings and customization**
- **Real-time chat interface**

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (compatible with TypeScript 5.6.3)
- npm or similar package manager

### Installation & Running

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```
   
2. **Start development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   
3. **Access the application:**
   Open `http://localhost:5000` in your browser

## 🔧 API Configuration (Optional)

For full AI functionality, configure these external APIs:

### Mistral AI Integration
Add to your `.env` file:
```env
MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_mistral_api_key_here
```
This enables AI responses for queries not found in the memory database.

### Other Optional APIs
- **OpenAI** (for additional AI capabilities)
- **Weather Service** (for weather-related queries)
- **Note**: Image generation is currently disabled as Mistral AI doesn't support image generation

## 🔍 Memory System

The vector-based memory system automatically:
- Loads conversation history from `memory/memories.txt`
- Provides context-aware responses based on past interactions
- Stores new conversations and user activity
- Enables face recognition and visual memory features
