Unlike classical computers that use bits (0 or 1), quantum computers use quantum bits (qubits) that can exist in multiple states simultaneously. This allows quantum computers to potentially solve certain complex problems exponentially faster than classical computers, particularly in areas like cryptography, optimization, and scientific simulation.",
